          Another interesting thing to note, Canada is an <span className="associate-member-text">associate member</span> since 1968. There are records of civilian matches being played in the late 1700's near Montreal, but the game started losing its popularity in the modern time.

          The British were not enthusiastic about the prospect of American participation in world cricket. When the ICC was established, it excluded countries from outside the British Empire from any role in its procedings, a move which undercut any movement towards the professionalization of the sport in the United States.
